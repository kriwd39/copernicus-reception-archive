# Copernicus Reception Archive

A collaborative digital humanities project to create a curated, annotated bibliography of primary and secondary sources documenting the initial scholarly and cultural reception of Nicolaus Copernicus's *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium* (1543).

## Purpose and Scope

This archive aims to collect and annotate sources that illustrate how Copernicus's heliocentric theory was received, debated, and integrated (or rejected) in the decades following its publication. The focus is on the period from 1543 to approximately 1600, covering scholarly, ecclesiastical, and popular reactions across Europe.

The project welcomes contributions from historians of science, astronomy, and early modern culture. All entries undergo peer review to ensure accuracy and scholarly rigor.

## Directory Structure

- `primary-sources/` – original works that mention, discuss, or respond to Copernicus's *De revolutionibus*. Subfolders organize entries by decade (`1540s/`, `1550s/`, etc.) and/or by type of reaction (`academic/`, `clerical/`, `astronomical/`).
- `secondary-sources/` – modern scholarly literature that analyzes the reception of Copernicus.
- `templates/` – templates for bibliography entries (see below).
- `contributing/` – guidelines for contributors, review process, and style guide.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Entry Format

Each bibliography entry should be a Markdown file (`.md`) following the template provided in `templates/entry-template.md`. The template includes fields for:

- **Author(s)**
- **Title** (original and translated, if applicable)
- **Publication details** (place, printer, year)
- **Language**
- **Short description** (1–2 sentences)
- **Annotation** (200–300 words) explaining the source's significance for Copernican reception, its arguments, and its historical context.
- **References** to relevant secondary literature (at least one).
- **Links** to digitized versions (if available).
- **Tags** (e.g., `astronomy`, `theology`, `mathematics`, `1540s`).

### Submission Process

1. **Fork** this repository and create a new branch for your entry.
2. **Create** a new Markdown file in the appropriate subfolder under `primary‑sources/` or `secondary‑sources/`.
3. **Open a Pull Request** (PR) with a clear title describing the added source.
4. **Link** the PR to an existing issue (if one exists) or create a new issue describing the source you intend to add.

### Review Process

- Every PR will be reviewed by at least one project editor.
- Reviewers will check for factual accuracy, proper citation, and adherence to the template.
- Inline comments may request clarifications, suggest additional references, or point out formatting issues.
- Once the review is satisfied, the PR will be merged using a squash commit to keep the history clean.

## Getting Started
